Electronic voting (e-voting) has been studied for many years. Recently, researchers find that blockchain can provide an alternative secure platform for e-voting systems, because of its properties of tamper resistance and transparency. However, existing blockchain-based schemes either require central authorities to tally ballots or can only handle a limited number of voters. This paper tries to propose a self-tallying e-voting system, i.e. the public can verify the validity of all ballots and tally the ballots without a centralized authority. To achieve this goal, we solve two challenges, namely how to cancel out all random numbers used for ballots and to prove the validity of ballots using a non-interactive zero knowledge proof. Our scheme is proved to be secure and shown to be practical by experiments.
