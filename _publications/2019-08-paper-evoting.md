E-voting has been studied for many years. Recently, researchers find that blockchain can provide an alternative secure platform for e-voting systems, because of its properties of tamper resistance and transparency. However, existing schemes either require centralized authorities to tally ballots or can only handle a limited number of voters. This paper tries to propose a self-tallying e-voting system, i.e., the public can verify the validity of all ballots and tally the ballots. To achieve this goal, technically, we design a new method on blockchain that can generate and distribute random numbers for ballot security and these random numbers will be cancelled out when multiplying all ballots to allow counting the ballots. Secondly, we adopt non-interactive zero knowledge proof to make sure these ballots are valid. Our scheme is proved to be secure.
