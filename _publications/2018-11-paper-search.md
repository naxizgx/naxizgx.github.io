It will be convenient for users if there is a market place that sells similar products provided by different suppliers. In physical world this may not be easy, in particular, if the suppliers are from different regions or countries. On the other hand, this is more feasible in the virtual world. The Global Big Data Exchange in Guiyang, China, which provides a market place for traders to buy and sell data, is a typical example.However, these virtual market places are owned by third parties. The security/privacy is a concern in addition to the expensive service charges.In this work, we propose a new privacy-preserving searching model on blockchain which enables a decentralized and secure virtual search-and-match market place. The core technical contribution is a new searchable encryption scheme for blockchain. We adopt the similarity preserving hash and leverage smart contracts to protect the system from the forgery attack and double-rewarding attack. We formally prove the security and privacy of our protocol, and evaluate our scheme on the private net ofEthereum platform. Our experimental results show that our protocol can work efficiently.
