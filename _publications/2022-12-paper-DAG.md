excerpt: 'This paper is about the composition of Sigma protocols for relations in CNF.'
# excerpt: 'At CRYPTO 1994, Cramer, Damg{\aa}rd and Schoenmakers proposed a general method to construct proofs of  knowledge (PoKs), especially for $k$-out-of-$n$ partial knowledge, of which relations can be expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF). Since then, proofs of $k$-out-of-$n$ partial knowledge have attracted much attention and some efficient constructions have been proposed.
#     However, many practical scenarios require efficient PoK protocols for partial knowledge in other forms.
#     In this paper, we mainly focus on PoK protocols for $k$-conjunctive normal form ($k$-CNF) relations, which have $n$ statements and can be expressed as follows: (i) $k$ statements constitute a clause via ``OR'' operations, and (ii) the relation consists of multiple clauses via ``AND'' operations. 
#     We propose an alternative Sigma protocol (called DAG-Σ protocol) for $k$-CNF relations (in the discrete logarithm setting), by converting these  relations to  directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  Our DAG-Σ protocol achieves less communication cost and smaller computational overhead compared with Cramer et al.\'s general method.'
