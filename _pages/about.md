I received a BSc in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2015, and a PhD in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong in 2020. Before I joined the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University as an Associate Professor, I worked as an Assistant Researcher at Pengcheng Laboratory.
